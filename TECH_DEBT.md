# Technical Debt - Shona Dictionary

This document outlines technical debt and areas for improvement that should be addressed in future iterations.

## üîß Build & Performance Issues

### 1. Force Dynamic Pages
**Issue**: Multiple pages are set to `force-dynamic` to avoid useSearchParams Suspense boundary errors.

**Current State**:
- `/` - `force-dynamic`
- `/browse` - `force-dynamic` 
- `/translate` - `force-dynamic`
- `/random` - `force-dynamic`
- `/suggest` - `force-dynamic`

**Impact**: 
- All pages are server-rendered on demand instead of being statically generated
- Reduced performance and caching benefits
- Higher server load

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement proper Suspense boundaries around components using `useSearchParams()`
- Separate client components that need search params from server components
- Use the pattern established in `/browse` with client/server component separation
- Consider using `searchParams` prop in server components where possible

### 2. SearchBar Component Architecture
**Issue**: SearchBar component uses `useSearchParams()` but is included in server components.

**Current State**:
- SearchBar is imported into server components
- Forces entire pages to be dynamic

**Recommended Fix**:
- Refactor SearchBar to be a pure server component that accepts search params as props
- Create a separate client component for interactive search functionality
- Implement proper loading states with Suspense boundaries

## üé® Styling & Design System

### 3. Inconsistent Theme Classes
**Issue**: Mix of old theme classes and new Tailwind classes across components.

**Current State**:
- Some components still use `theme-text`, `theme-input`, `bg-surface`
- New components use proper Tailwind classes
- Inconsistent dark mode implementation

**Recommended Fix**:
- Audit all components for old theme classes
- Standardize on Tailwind utility classes
- Create a design system documentation
- Implement consistent dark mode patterns

### 4. Component Structure Inconsistency
**Issue**: Different patterns for client/server component separation.

**Current State**:
- `/browse` uses proper client/server separation
- `/translate` uses single client component
- Other pages have mixed approaches

**Recommended Fix**:
- Standardize on client/server component patterns
- Create reusable layout components
- Establish consistent file naming conventions

## üîç Search & Data Management

### 5. Data Service Architecture
**Issue**: Data service mixes synchronous and asynchronous patterns.

**Current State**:
- Some methods return data directly
- Others should be async for better performance
- No proper error handling for data loading

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement proper async data loading
- Add error boundaries and loading states
- Consider implementing data caching strategies
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### 6. Search Implementation
**Issue**: Search functionality is scattered across multiple components.

**Current State**:
- Search logic in multiple places
- No centralized search state management
- Inconsistent search result handling

**Recommended Fix**:
- Centralize search logic in a custom hook
- Implement proper search state management
- Add search result caching
- Implement debounced search for better UX

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### 7. Bundle Size Optimization
**Issue**: Large JavaScript bundles for simple pages.

**Current State**:
- First Load JS: 105-178 kB per page
- No code splitting for large components
- All pages load full component tree

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- Split admin components from public components
- Optimize bundle splitting strategy
- Implement proper lazy loading

### 8. Static Generation Opportunities
**Issue**: Missing opportunities for static generation.

**Current State**:
- Most pages are dynamic when they could be static
- No ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) implementation
- Dictionary entries could be pre-generated

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement static generation for dictionary entries
- Use ISR for frequently accessed content
- Pre-generate popular search results
- Implement proper caching strategies

## üîí Security & Best Practices

### 9. Admin Route Security
**Issue**: Admin routes are hidden via config but not properly secured.

**Current State**:
- Admin routes redirect to 404 in production
- No authentication or authorization
- Admin components still bundled in production

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement proper authentication system
- Add role-based access control
- Exclude admin code from production builds entirely
- Add proper security headers

### 10. Error Handling
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across the application.

**Current State**:
- Some components have error states
- No global error boundary
- API errors not properly handled

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement global error boundary
- Add consistent error UI components
- Implement proper API error handling
- Add error logging and monitoring

## üì± Mobile & Accessibility

### 11. Mobile Optimization
**Issue**: Mobile experience could be improved.

**Current State**:
- Basic responsive design implemented
- Some components not optimized for mobile
- Touch interactions could be better

**Recommended Fix**:
- Audit mobile experience across all pages
- Implement proper touch interactions
- Optimize mobile navigation
- Add mobile-specific optimizations

### 12. Accessibility Improvements
**Issue**: Accessibility features need enhancement.

**Current State**:
- Basic ARIA labels implemented
- Keyboard navigation partially implemented
- Screen reader support could be better

**Recommended Fix**:
- Complete accessibility audit
- Implement proper focus management
- Add comprehensive ARIA attributes
- Test with screen readers

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### 13. Testing Infrastructure
**Issue**: No automated testing implemented.

**Current State**:
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No end-to-end tests

**Recommended Fix**:
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Implement unit tests for core components
- Add integration tests for search functionality
- Set up E2E tests for critical user flows

### 14. Code Quality Tools
**Issue**: Limited code quality enforcement.

**Current State**:
- ESLint and TypeScript checks disabled during builds
- No pre-commit hooks
- No code formatting enforcement

**Recommended Fix**:
- Re-enable ESLint and TypeScript strict mode
- Set up Prettier for code formatting
- Implement pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Add code quality CI/CD checks

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### 15. Performance Monitoring
**Issue**: No performance monitoring implemented.

**Current State**:
- No performance metrics collection
- No error tracking
- No user analytics

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement performance monitoring (e.g., Vercel Analytics)
- Add error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up user analytics for usage insights
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
