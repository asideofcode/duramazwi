Pote (Official Lyric Video) - Learn Shona & Shona Prince ft Tamy 
Learn Shona ft Shona Prince Tamy Moyo

Akangoti Pote
(When she leaves my side)

Hana yotorova
(My heart skips a beat)

Akangoti Simu
(If she just stands up)

Hana yotorova
(My heart skips a beat)

Ndokufunga ndichimuka
(I think about you when I wake up)

Ndokurinda uchisuka
(I will watch you as you do the dishes)

Tiri bhande nebhurugwa
(We are like a belt and trousers)

Ngatisa paradzane
(May we be together forever/let's not destroy each other)

Ndokufunga ndichimuka
(I think about you when I wake up)

Ndokurinda uchisuka
(I will watch you as you do the dishes)

iF YOU TEACH me how to love better
(Ukandidzidzisa kukupa rudo)

Ndotodzidzira
(I can learn from you/I will surely learn from you)

Moyo wako wave wangy bhebhi
(Your hide is mine, babe)

Wotopfigira
(Keep it safe)

Thema Lami
Ungkhali ntombi [NDEBELE]
(Trust me, don't cry)


We gon live it up
(Tichanakidzwa)


Nyangwe zvikadini
(No matter what happens)

I will never leave you wega (alone)
(Handikusiye)

When the bass line kicking
(Mangoma achirira)

Girl your wasteline wicked
(Chiuno chako chakaipa)

I will be working
(Ndinenge nichishanda)

through the weekend
(panopera vhiki)

Till I'm earning 6 digits
(Kusvika ndabata million)

Got me feeling like Romeo
(Ndakunzwa kunge ndiri Romeo)

And you're my juliet,
(Iwewe uri Juliet wangu)

Every minute, every second, I wanna know
(Nguva dzose, ndoda kuziva)

Kuti (that) where you at

Tiri bhande nebhurugwa
(We are like a belt and trousers)

Ngatisa paradzane
(May we be together forever/let's not destroy each other)

Ndokufunga ndichimuka
(I think about you when I wake up)

Ndokurinda uchisuka
(I will watch you as you do the dishes)

Handimbo zvipotse maziso anoona
(I won't miss it the eyes can see)

Unotombo zvivhunza kuti ndini?
(I ask myself is this me?)

I kiss your lips then you believe me
(Ndokutsvoda wobva wabeliever)

Never leave me
(Usandisiye)


Now stuck to you like glue
(Ndanamira pauri kunge pashanda glue)

You are my everything
(Uri zvese kwandiri)

Tiri bhande nebhurugwa
(We are like a belt and trousers)

Whenever you leave 
(pese paunoenda)

Ndinozviziva unodzoka
(I know you're always come back)


Muhana unodzoka mumoyo maangu
(In my heart i know you will come back to me)

Kundishaya babe haugone
(You can't live without me/You won't be able to not find me)

Vamwe avo ini handimbode
(I don't want any other person)

Huya paduze coz
(Come closer because)

The street are lonely
(Hakuna vanhu muround)

Pandinoti pote babe hande
(When I make a move lets go babe)

Akangoti Pote
(When she leaves my side)

Hana yotorova
(My heart skips a beat)

Akangoti Simu
(If she just stands up)

Hana yotorova
(My heart skips a beat)

Ndokufunga ndichimuka
(I think about you when I wake up)

Ndokurinda uchisuka
(I will watch you as you do the dishes)

Tiri bhande nebhurugwa
(We are like a belt and trousers)

Ngatisa paradzane
(May we be together forever/let's not destroy each other)

Ndokufunga ndichimuka
(I think about you when I wake up)

Ndokurinda uchisuka
(I will watch you as you do the dishes)
