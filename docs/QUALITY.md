# Plan for Managing Content Quality in the Dictionary App

This plan outlines the strategy for ensuring high-quality dictionary content through automated seeding, community contributions, and rigorous review processes. The goal is to create an accurate, culturally meaningful, and community-driven Shona-English and English-Shona dictionary.


## 1. Foundation: Seeded Content
### Current Status:
- Content has been seeded using automated processes (e.g., OCR and AI structuring) based on reliable sources like the _Shona-English and English-Shona Dictionary and Phrasebook_.
- Data has been structured into a standardized JSON schema to support initial deployment.

### Challenges:
- Automated extraction might introduce errors in meanings, part-of-speech classification, or contextual examples.
- Initial content may lack comprehensive coverage or cultural nuance.

### Mitigation Plan:
- Conduct a baseline review by domain experts or linguists to identify and fix major inaccuracies in the seeded data.
- Tag all AI-generated content for easier tracking and prioritization for review.

## 2. Community Contribution Model
### Objective:
Leverage the community's knowledge to improve and expand the dictionary through contributions and feedback.

### Contribution Types:
- **Additions:** Suggesting new words, meanings, or contextual examples.
- **Edits:** Proposing changes to existing entries, such as fixing errors or refining examples.
- **Reviews:** Providing feedback on suggested additions or edits.

### Workflow:
1. User Submissions:
   - Introduce a **"Contribute"** button on the app interface for users to:
     - Submit new entries.
     - Suggest edits to existing entries.
   - Provide forms with a clear structure aligned with the current data schema.

2. Moderation Pipeline:
   - Implement a review pipeline where all contributions are flagged for moderation:
     - **Phase 1:** Automatic validation for format and basic accuracy using AI.
     - **Phase 2:** Peer review by trusted community members (e.g., linguists, educators).
     - **Phase 3:** Final review by administrators before publication.

3. Transparency:
   - Show pending contributions in a **"Contributions"** tab for transparency and encourage collaboration.
   - Provide badges or recognition for active contributors.

## 3. User Feedback Mechanism
### Objective:
Enable users to provide feedback directly from the app to report errors or suggest improvements.

### Features:
- **"Report Issue" Button:** 
  - Allow users to flag specific words or meanings as incorrect or incomplete.
  - Feedback is routed to the moderation pipeline for resolution.
- **Rating System:** 
  - Enable users to rate the accuracy or usefulness of definitions and examples.
  - Use ratings to prioritize entries for review.

## 4. Quality Assurance (QA) and Review
### Objective:
Ensure all dictionary content maintains high accuracy and cultural relevance.

### Workflow:
1. Initial QA:
   - After seeding, perform a thorough manual review of a representative sample of entries to identify patterns of errors (e.g., OCR misinterpretations, incorrect part-of-speech tags).
   - Address systemic issues across the dataset.

2. Ongoing QA:
   - Use the moderation pipeline for user contributions to maintain content quality.
   - Regularly audit a subset of entries for accuracy, especially those with high usage or low ratings.

3. Cultural Sensitivity Review:
   - Collaborate with native speakers and linguists to validate contextual examples and ensure cultural appropriateness.

## 5. Transition to a Database
### Current State:
- The dictionary is stored as a JSON file, which is sufficient for the early stages but may become unwieldy as the dataset grows.

### Future Plan:
1. Database Integration:
   - Migrate the JSON data to a scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
   - Leverage database features like indexing and relationships to improve query performance and enable richer data modeling.

2. Real-Time Updates:
   - Use the database to manage real-time updates for user contributions, removing the need for static version control.
   - Automatically log changes and maintain a history of modifications for transparency.

3. Audit Trail:
   - Implement a lightweight audit trail in the database to track:
     - Who made changes.
     - When the changes were made.
     - The type of changes (e.g., additions, edits).


## 6. Automation and AI Assistance
### Objective:
Utilize AI to streamline content validation and enrichment.

### Current Capabilities:
- Fuzzy matching to identify similar entries during searches and flag duplicates.
- Enrichment of entries with contextual examples and inferred part-of-speech tags.

### Future Enhancements:
1. Validation Models:
   - Train models on validated data to detect and correct errors in new contributions automatically.
2. Search and Suggestion:
   - Implement AI-driven suggestions for missing related words (e.g., synonyms, antonyms).
3. Feedback Analysis:
   - Analyze user feedback to identify recurring issues and prioritize QA efforts.


## 7. Governance and Policies
### Community Guidelines:
- Define clear guidelines for contributors, such as:
  - Using reliable sources for new entries.
  - Providing culturally appropriate examples.
  - Respecting linguistic diversity within the Shona language (e.g., regional variations).

### Review Board:
- Establish a small review board of linguists, educators, and native speakers to oversee:
  - Final approval of controversial edits.
  - Resolution of disputes among contributors.


## 8. Scaling the Dataset
### Expansion Goals:
- Add dialectal variations, slang, and idiomatic expressions.
- Integrate pronunciation guides, audio examples, and etymological information.

### Collaboration Opportunities:
- Partner with universities, language schools, and cultural organizations to source new data and validate entries.
